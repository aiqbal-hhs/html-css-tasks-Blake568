<p>We've all seen the armours knights are given in movies and games, full plate armour with a big sword or spear maybe they through in some chainmail
to make the knight look cooler. while knights did wear full plate armour it was normally very stiff, it traded stiffness for protection. Steel plate armour would block and deflect most sword slashes and arrow hits. The wearer might get harmed if an opponent thrusted their blade however. but most steel plate armours had a sort of bulge on the sturnum or belly, if an arrow were to hit in that area the arrow would be redirected away from the wearer same goes for swords.</p>

<p>Knights didn't only wear steel plate armour, sometimes it was better to wear linen armour or chainmail armour, you'd be well protected as well as being able to move rather well. linen armour was most popular in the 13th century when it was used wide spread due to it's flexiblity and suprising protecting. Later in the 14th century it was used as an under armour with chainmail gussests. The use of both steel plate and linen cloth would have made an almost unkillable soldier.</p>
