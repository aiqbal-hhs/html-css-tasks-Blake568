<h2>Knights</h2>
<p>Knights originated from Europe in the 9th century. 
Most knights started as squires, cleaning the knights horses cleaning and waxing thier weapons and entering battle with them.
after five to six years of sercive squires would be knighted at a dubbing ceromony.
the newly found knight would take an oath at this ceromony to protect his king and church.
Knights in the 13 century were not as honourable as you'd think, they were violent and were rewarded with land or a license to plunder and loot the area of were they battled. The rewarded land was very important for the knights because most were farmers when they weren't in battle plundering and killing of course.
